# MNIST-CNN

This program uses a the MNIST dataset to train a simple CNN of couple layers to recognize digits that you show through the webcam. Pytorch and OpenCV were used for this.
After training the model tests itself providing the accuracy.
The webcam will turn on and two windows will appear, what the webcam captures with a green square in which you have to centre the digits you wrote; and the other window is the b/w image fed to the cnn (before compression)

### To use
After training and webcam is on press 'q' to take a 28x28 screenshot of what the cnn sees, and press 'e' to exit the program.
