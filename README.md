# MNIST-Multi-Layer-Perceptron

This program will import the MNIST dataset, and then train a double layer MLP model to recognize digits written by hand, test and return the accuracy (usually between 96% and 97.5%) in the 28x28 MNIST format.
The images of the digits will appear randomly and both the prediction and real label will be showed, to go through the photos press enter in the terminal, and to exit the program type "end".
